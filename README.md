Welcome to my Timely project!

Timely is a calendar and a goal/time tracker all in one application.
My UX/UI Design course prompted me to create this concept.
I had so much fun making the prototype so I decided to bring it into fruition and actually develop the application.
As a student myself, this app is something that I personally would make great use of.
I want to make a seamless and interactive interface for users to enjoy and utilize.
To achieve this, I'm incorporating the ReactJS framework, which I have not yet learned in school.
I'm learning it as I develop this application and having fun while doing so :D
As you can see, this is a work in progress. I'll be working on it little by little while learning bit by bit.
